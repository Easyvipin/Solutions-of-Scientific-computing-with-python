# INTRODUCTION :boom:
This repo is all about the solutions of different challanges on freecodecamp course (scientific computing with python) with **Explanation**

This course divided into two parts
1. [***python for Everybody***](#python-for-everybody)
2. ***scientific computing with python Projects***

# python for everybody

***A set of commands to instruct the device or computer to accomplish some task is called  PROGRAMMNG.***

### why programming?
-> To perform different task which human are incapable of or takes a lot of time to a complete.

## Hardware Architecture
Its very important to understand the structure of computer or basic device and how each of its components works with eachother when we execute our Program.

### Basic Hardware Structure

1. I/O DEVICE
2. MICROPROCESSOR
3. MEMORY

##### Python as a Language

What will print out after running these two lines of code:
```
x = 6
print(x)
```

<ins> solution </ins>
```
x = 6 // assign the value(6) to variable x .The x is just a reference to some memory location where 6 is stored.
print(x) // search for x and output the value of x
output : 6

```
#####  Elements of PythonPassed
What will the following program print out:
```
x = 43
x = x + 1
print(x)

```
<ins> solution </ins>
```
x = 43 // asignment
x = x + 1 //x = 43 + 1 
print(x) // 44
output : 44
```
#####  Variables, Expressions, and StatementsPassed

What is the symbol used in an assignment statement?:
```
answer : = //  to assign any value to variable is called assignment in programming language and in all the languages =(equal to ) sign is used for assignment.
```
#####  Intermediate ExpressionsPassed

What will print out after running this code:
```
width = 15
height = 12.0
print(height/3)
```
<ins> solution </ins>

```
print(height/3) // 12.0 / 3 
output:4
```

#####  Conditional Execution

Which code is indented correctly to print "Yes" if `x = 0` and `y = 10`? 

<ins> solution </ins>

```
if 0 == x:
    if y == 10:
        print("Yes")
        
```

#####  

What will print out after running this code:
```
width = 15
height = 12.0
print(height/3)
```
<ins> solution </ins>

```
print(height/3) // 12.0 / 3 
output:4
```
